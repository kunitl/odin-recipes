    <h2>üë©‚Äçüç≥ Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Soak the rice</h3>
          <p>Rinse the sticky rice several times until the water runs clear. Soak in water for at least 4 hours or overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Steam the rice</h3>
          <p>Drain the soaked rice and steam it for 20-25 minutes until fully cooked and tender.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Make the coconut sauce</h3>
          <p>In a saucepan, heat the coconut milk, sugar, and salt over medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves. For thicker sauce, dissolve cornstarch in a little water and add it to the mixture. Simmer briefly and remove from heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Mix sauce with rice</h3>
          <p>Pour about 2/3 of the warm coconut sauce over the hot sticky rice. Mix gently and let it sit for 15-20 minutes to absorb.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare the mango</h3>
          <p>Peel the mango and slice it into thin pieces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Serve</h3>
          <p>Place sticky rice on a plate, top with mango slices, and drizzle with the remaining coconut sauce. Sprinkle with sesame seeds or mung beans if desired. Garnish with a flower for a beautiful touch.</p>
